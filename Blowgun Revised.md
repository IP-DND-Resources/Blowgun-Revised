# Blowgun
The Blowgun is a seldom used weapon due to its lack of damage and no addition of a damage modifier. Typically relegated to being a 'fun' item or for delivering poisons. This content intends to make Blowgun a viable choice for a specific playstyle.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 27; Damage Rolls

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun.

## Blowgun (Revised)
*Martial Ranged Weapon*, 1 lb. 10 GP
:
**Damage** - 1 Piercing  
**Properties*** - Ammunition (Range 25/100; Needle), Loading, Two-Handed, Obscure, Precise.  
**Mastery** - Vex

(*) This weapon is also considered to have Finesse for any prerequisite that requires a weapon to have Finesse.

### Properties
### Obscure
When you attack a creature with this weapon while you have the Invisible condition, make a DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check. On a failure, you lose the Invisible condition and creatures within 10 feet of the target are aware of you and your location. On a success, you maintain the Invisible condition.

### Precise
Attacks with this weapon can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 17-20 on the d20. When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to the damage dealt by the weapon. When you score a Critical Hit, you can double this bonus damage.


## Implications
##### Light Property
The average damage with increased Critical Hit chance from Vex is still on average worse than any other weapon with Light. Having a second Blowgun allows you to fire twice as many poisoned Needles in a turn, at double the consumption rate of GP. Most Poisons that apply conditions give the poisoned creature a repeat save every turn, reducing the likelyhood that conditions stay applied.

\column

##### 1d4 Weapon Damage
With a critical rate of 5%, a 1d4 weapon with a +3 damage modifier does an average damage of 5.625.

2.5 (Avg Roll) * 1.05 (5% Crit chance) + 3 (Ability modifier) = 5.625

##### Blowgun Damage with Precise
With a critical rate of 20%, a Blowgun with a +3 damage modifier does an average damage of 4.6, or 1.025 less than a 1d4 weapon on average.

3 (Ability modifier) * 1.20 (20% Crit chance to double Ability modifier) + 1 (Weapon Damage) = 4.6

##### Critical Hit

Having a 20% Critical Hit chance means that creatures with high AC become much easier to hit, but this only applies to an AC of 24+. In the 2024 Monster Manual, there is 1 monster with an AC of 24+: Terrasque. The following table assumes a Proficiency bonus of +3 and an Ability modifier of +3 (+6 to hit).

###### Chance to miss
|AC|5% Crit|20% Crit|
|:---|:---|:---|
|22|75%|75%|
|23|80%|80%|
|24|85%|80%|
|25|90%|80%|
|26|95%|80%|
|27|95%|80%|

Mastery with a Blowgun gives Advantage, increasing the chance to Critically Hit to 36% (20% + [15.9%](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2014/07/12/dnd-5e-advantage-disadvantage-probability/)) brining average damage to 5.08.

##### Poisoner Feat
This should be assumed to reference "Basic Poison" when it says poison. With all of the considerations and bonuses, this only brings a Blowgun in line with comparable weapon damages.
